Use ONLY facts explicitly present in the supplied opportunity text and retrieved student evidence.

If evidence is insufficient, say so clearly. Distinguish facts from suggestions.

Analyze only the uploaded opportunity. Extract what is explicitly stated.
Return JSON with keys:
opportunity_type, eligibility_requirements, education_requirements, required_skills,
required_experience, preferred_qualifications, documents_required, important_criteria,
application_questions, other_requirements.
Each value should be a concise list of strings. Do not add unstated requirements.

Compare the opportunity requirements against the supplied student evidence.
Return JSON with keys:
matches, gaps, unclear, evidence_by_requirement, category_scores.
matches/gaps/unclear are lists of concise strings.
evidence_by_requirement is a list of objects with requirement, status (match/gap/unclear),
and evidence (list of source labels).
category_scores must contain eligibility, skills, experience, documents, other as numbers 0-100.
Only mark a match when evidence supports it. Missing evidence is not proof of absence, so use unclear when appropriate.

Write a polished answer to the student's application question.
Use the opportunity context only when it helps answer the question.
Use only the retrieved profile evidence for personal claims.
If evidence is insufficient, state that you could not find enough information instead of fabricating.

Create a tailored resume in Markdown using only supplied student evidence.
Prioritize evidence relevant to the opportunity. Do not create any unsupported facts, metrics, dates,

If a section lacks evidence, omit it rather than inventing content.
